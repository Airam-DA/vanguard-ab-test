# **Transforming User Experience: Vanguard A/B Test Results**
This repository contains the analysis of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned user interface (UI). The new UI introduced modern design elements and in-context prompts to enhance the user experience. This project explores the experiment's results, focusing on user behavior, completion rates, and efficiency improvements.

## Context & Study Design

This test was conducted to address a major pain point: Vanguard clients often abandon an essential online process‚Äî not due to a lack of intent, but because the interface frustrates them. These moments of friction impact efficiency, client satisfaction, and long-term revenue.

### Experiment Overview:
- **Duration**: March 15, 2017 ‚Äì June 20, 2017
- **Control Group**: Used Vanguard's traditional online process.
- **Test Group**: Experienced the redesigned, modern interface.
- **Process Flow**: An initial page, three steps, and a confirmation page.

**Objective**: Determine if the updated UI improves completion rates and enhances the user experience.

# üìà A/B Test Raw Data Exploration
The raw data consisted of three datasets capturing demographic, behavioral, and web interaction data:

1. **`df_demo` (Client Demographics and Behavior Data)**
   - Provides insights into client demographics, account details, and recent activity.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `clnt_tenure_yr`, `clnt_tenure_mnth`: Client tenure
     - `clnt_age`: Client age
     - `gendr`: Gender
     - `num_accts`: Number of accounts
     - `bal`: Account balance
     - `calls_6_mnth`, `logons_6_mnth`: Recent client activity

2. **`df_experiment_clients` (Experiment Group Data)**
   - Identifies which group (control or test) each client belongs to.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `variation`: Test or control group assignment

3. **`df_web_data_pt_1` and `df_web_data_pt_2` (Web Interaction Data)**
   - Captures client interactions with the online process.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `visitor_id`: Client-device identifier
     - `visit_id`: Web session identifier
     - `process_step`: Step in the online process
     - `date_time`: Timestamp of interaction

---

# ‚úÖ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 1. **Merging and Consolidation**
   - Unified `df_web_data_pt_1` and `df_web_data_pt_2` into a single DataFrame using `pd.concat()`.
   - Merged demographic and experiment data (`df_demo` and `df_experiment_clients`) using an outer join on `client_id`.
   - Combined web interaction and demographic data into a final DataFrame (`df`) using a left join on `client_id`.

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Dropped rows with missing `control_test` values (~57% of rows).
   - Filled missing demographic and numeric values with 0.
   - Assigned "U" (Unknown) to missing gender values.

### 3. **Standardizing and Cleaning Columns**
   - Renamed columns to follow a consistent format: lowercase, underscores instead of spaces.
   - Organized columns for usability.

### 4. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows based on `session_id`, `client_dev_id`, `process_step`, and `date_time`.

### 5. **Data Type Adjustments**
   - Converted `date_time` to a datetime format.
   - Adjusted numeric columns to appropriate types.

### 6. **Enhancements and Segmentations**
   - **Process Step Sorting**:
     - Added numeric prefixes to `process_step` (e.g., `start` ‚Üí `0_start`) to ensure proper sorting. 
     - Converted `process_step` into an ordered categorical column for analysis.
   - **Age Groups**:
     - Segmented clients into age ranges (e.g., 16-30, 31-40).
   - **Balance Segments**:
     - Categorized balances into meaningful ranges (e.g., 0-50k, 50-150k).

# ‚ú® KPI Insights

![kpis_pb](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/488ac391-2d92-4859-bb57-46a5fc80ab27)

#### 1. **Completion Rate**
   - **Definition**: The number of users who reached the ‚Äòconfirm‚Äô step divided by the total number of users in that group.
   - **Control**: 49.85%  
   - **Test**: 58.52%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group shows a notable increase in completion rate compared to the Control group, which indicates that the changes implemented in the Test version had a positive impact on user engagement and the likelihood of completing the process.

![10_Step Completion Rates  Control vs Test Group](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5769b2-a42a-479c-85e2-eca02f047530)

#### 2. **Average Time per Step (s)**
   - **Definition**: The average time spent by users on each process step, measured in seconds.
   - **Control**: 96.68 seconds  
   - **Test**: 93.17 seconds  
   - **Insight**: Users in the Test group take slightly less time per step, suggesting improved efficiency. This could be a result of a more intuitive process flow or interface, leading to faster task completion.

#### 3. **Error Rate**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of users who move backward in the process, indicating errors or confusion.
   - **Control**: 19.08%  
   - **Test**: 24.26%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group has a higher error rate, which is a point of concern. This could be indicative of issues with the new interface or process flow, possibly creating confusion that leads to more errors, despite the higher completion rate.

#### 4. **Drop-Off Rate**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of users who leave the process at each step.
   - **Control**: 32.31%  
   - **Test**: 30.06%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group demonstrates a lower drop-off rate, suggesting that users in the Test group are less likely to abandon the process. This reflects better retention, which could be attributed to the more engaging or user-friendly design in the Test group.

#### 5. **Completion Rates by Balance Segment**
   - **Definition**: The completion rates segmented by balance categories, showing how different user groups (based on account balance) perform in the process.
   - **Insight**: The Test group generally performs better than the Control group in terms of completion rates, especially in the lower to mid-balance segments (0-500k). However, the 5M+ balance segment shows the lowest completion rate in the Test group (50%), suggesting that high-net-worth clients face challenges, even with the changes tested.

![11 Completion Rate by Balance Segment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70126ffe-97bb-4986-a16b-5d73fbc31618)

---

### **Overall Summary**  
- **Positive**: The Test group shows higher completion rates, faster task completion, and lower drop-offs, indicating that the changes introduced are generally favorable for user experience.  
- **Improvement Needed**: The higher error rate in the Test group should be investigated further to identify and resolve potential usability issues that may be affecting the overall user experience.
